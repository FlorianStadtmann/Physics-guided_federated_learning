# Physics-guided_federated_learning
Authors: Florian Stadtmann, Erik Rugaard Furevik, Adil Rasheed, Trond Kvamsdal

This repository provides the code used for the paper "Physics-guided federated learning as an enabler for digital twins" for experiments 3-6. The code for experiments 1-2 can be found at https://github.com/erikfurevik/ml-turbine-analysis.

To run experiments 3-6, the "Prepare_Data" notebook must be executed first. 
In addition to the specified Python modules, it requires the airfoil data from the IEA 10MW reference wind turbine (available at https://github.com/IEAWindTask37/IEA-10.0-198-RWT) and XFOIL (https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/).

Python version: 3.8.8
